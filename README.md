# Hello, it's @angelabernaldz! :wave:

My name is Angela, and I work as a Climate Data Scientist. :earth_africa: :sun_behind_rain_cloud: On my day-to-day work, I use Linux and Python as coding languages, and some other tools such as SQL for loading climate data from databases. :computer:

I'm currently on the very early stage of learning web development to expand my skill set and be able to create impactful web applications in the future.
